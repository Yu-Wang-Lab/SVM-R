# SVM-R
SVM model creation for R

The first file is unrelated to the other two files. Is considered the base code to use as reference for making the others.

The second file is training the model __without__ spliting the data. This means that the data will only train on itself. This file is used to make a csv with the top 100 most
important variables.

The third file takes the top 100 variables and performs the final model creation.
